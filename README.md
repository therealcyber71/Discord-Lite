A Light-Weight Discord Client written in **Python** for developers, by developers. \
More in the [wiki](https://github.com/Sachit71/Discord-Lite/wiki)
## ❓ Explanation
You may have possibly heard and used Discord once in your life, right?

It can be very resource-intensive, especially with other programs running in the background.

Hence, why `Discord-Lite` was made.

It uses less memory and loads GIFs faster compared to the Client and Website version of Discord.\
It also supports sending & recieving Images, Videos, and other files.

### ***Note: Do not download from the releases page, instead head over to the installer directory and install from [this](https://github.com/therealcyber71/Discord-Lite/blob/main/installer/Discord-Lite-1.2.exe) link. Due to some mistake on our side, the v1.1 gets downloaded, hence please refrain from downloading the installer from releases and use the link provided. Sorry for the inconvenience caused!***

## ⭐ Clarifications
This isn't any over-the-top "client" of such.\
This is simply a Discord Web Instance running in a "Custom Browser" to reduce memory usage and *not* feast on your RAM.

★ Feel free to leave a [star](https://i.imgur.com/P9YZMnF.gif) on this repo if you liked it! ★

## 👀 Inspiration & Sources
This is basically a modified version of the [*Geeks For Geeks*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) tutorial on ["How to Make a Web Browser using PyQt5"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-a-simple-browser-using-pyqt5/).\
So, I decided to modify it into a web-based Discord Client since it runs Google instances so well.

## 👋 Contributions
Any useful contribution are welcome.\
Preference will be given to those who can solve the drawback issues or implement the To-Do List features in their PR.\
Happy Coding, nonetheless! ^^

## 💢 Drawbacks
There are a few drawbacks to this, including:
- Streaming won't work.
- Videos other than `.mov` and `.webm` formats load **in**consistently.

## 📃 To-Do List
> Solve JavaScript errors through QT.

### ...and that's about it.

## 🛠️ Known issues
~~Currently, Version `1.1` contains many bugs including *multiple* ***unnecessary*** tabs open upon execution causing your machine to freeze.\
The logo won't load which will be fixed in the next update.~~\
Supposedly fixed in version `1.2`. Open an issue, if this still persists.

## 💾 Compatibility
> Tested for Windows 10/11 with Python 3.9\
> Issues on other systems can be openly reported.

## 📎 Installation
* `pip`

```bash
pip3 install discord_lite
```

...then in your python file:

```python
import discord_lite
```

* `Windows`
> For now, Install the `.zip` from this [source.](https://github.com/Sachit71/Discord-Lite/blob/main/installer/Discord-Lite-1.2.exe)


After that, open `Discord-Lite.exe` from your desktop.\
You should be able to use Discord just as you can with any other client. :D
