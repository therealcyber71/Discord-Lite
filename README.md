A Light-Weight Discord Client written in **Python**, with love. \
More in the [wiki](https://github.com/Sachit71/Discord-Lite/wiki)
## ❓ Explanation
You may have possibly heard and used Discord once in your life, right?

It can be very resource-intensive, especially with other programs running in the background.

Hence, why `Discord-Lite` was made.

It uses less memory and loads GIFs faster compared to the Client and Website version of Discord.\
It also supports sending & recieving Images, Videos, and other files.



## ⭐ Clarifications
This isn't any over-the-top "client" of such.\
This is simply a Discord Web Instance running in a "Custom Browser" to reduce memory usage and *not* feast on your RAM.

## 👀 Inspiration & Sources
This is basically a modified version of the [*Geeks For Geeks*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) tutorial on ["How to Make a Web Browser using PyQt5"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-a-simple-browser-using-pyqt5/).\
So, I decided to modify it into a web-based Discord Client since it runs Google instances so well. \
I then used [PyWebview](https://pypi.org/project/pywebview/), to improve on some features.
